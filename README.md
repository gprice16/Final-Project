# ML_Final_Project
We used a github repository from another user containing 220 images of poison ivy leaves and 220 images of raspberry leaves. We then compared 4 machine learning
models' ability to correctly classify these images. The 4 models we used include: Linear regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVM, and CNN. 

## 1. Datasets Used for Our Dataset:
  - https://github.com/bazilione/poison_ivy/blob/master/data_all.zip

## 2. Classical Models:
1. Logistic Regression: provided an 85.2% accuracy.
2. Naive Bayesian model: provided an 88.7% accuracy.
3. SVM: provided an 86.4% accuracy.
4. CNN: provided a 75% accuracy

##3. How to run:
Once the dataset is downloaded to your Google Drive, this code is meant to be run in a linear fashion from top to bottom 
in order of how the cells are placed. Once all cells have been run, the demo cell can be run seperately to test a variaty of images
from the dataset.
